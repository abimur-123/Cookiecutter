# Cookie cutter

Cookie cutter provides a folder structure for sharing and developing data science work. This project is inspired by a similar project developed by [Daniel Chen](https://github.com/chendaniely/computational-project-cookie-cutter).

## Folder structure

The ```cookie.sh``` script creates the following folder structure

```
root
|
|-- README
|-- LICENSE
|-- data
|   --
|-- docs
|   --  
|-- models
|   --
|-- results
|   --
|-- scripts
|   --
|-- CITATIONS
|-- CONTRIBUTING
|-- CONDUCT
|-- REQUIREMENTS
```

## How to download

1. Fork/clone the repo to your system.
2. Download the cookie.sh file by ```right-click > save link as..``` from the ```raw``` button.

## How to run it

Navigate to the folder where the file ```cookie.sh``` is saved and run the following command from the terminal -

```bash cookie.sh```

The script will have prompts to specify location of directory and name of the project folder.

An example of the path that can be specified -

```/c/Users/User1/Desktop```

*Note*: The output can be observed in the project folder created in this path

## Other cookie cutter projects

There are others trying to develop similar cookie cutter templates for data science projects if my project does not meet your requirements -
